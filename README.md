The Web Game Source is the open source framework to start your own online Webgame and earn money.

The Web Game Source is not like other Webgames! This is a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game and has a default theme in the Mafia genre with over 500 game options! Players role play as gangsters and work together in families or crews in order to attain high net worth, high rank and skills, and/or the respect of (or fear from) their peers. The Web Game Source is browser based games that use either a real-time or turn-based system to permit players to interact with the game. 

In the turn-based system, turns are awarded at regular intervals, and players may expend these turns in order to perform actions. Turns can also sometimes be earned (by achieving certain goals) or purchased (directly, or through account upgrades). However, most Extreme Mobsters is real-time, and do not have the same sort of turn limitations. Often, certain actions are limited by a throttle that only permits the action once per an interval of time. Players can perform the action as many times as they wish, time-permitting.
